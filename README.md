# Sound Block
Sound can be percieved in 3 main components.

## Pitch
Nyquist theorem

## Loudness
loudness is a subjective perception of sound intensity and is measured using decibels;
loundness is related to intensity which is the power (energy over time) of the sound per unit area.

intensity is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of vibration.

### fyi:
humans are capable of detecting a range of intensities from
1*10^-12 W/m^2  to  1W/m^2. 
sound intensity is specified using a logarithmic scale known as the sound level.
sound level (decibels) is defined by 10*logbase10(intensity/reference intensity)
reference intensity is typically used as the minimum intensity audible to humans

can be complex but theres a typical algorithm for calculating loudness with
RMS amplitude (average power); 
A-weighting is often incorporated as humans are more sensitive to certain frequencies.
